# Battlesnake Rust Project

A Battlesnake written in Rust. Get started at [play.battlesnake.com](https://play.battlesnake.com).

## Technologies Used

This project uses [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) and [Rocket](https://rocket.rs). It also comes with an optional [Dockerfile](https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/) to help with deployment.

## Run Your Battlesnake

```sh
cargo run
```

You should see the following output once it is running

```sh
🚀 Rocket has launched from http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

Open [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) in your browser and you should see

```json
{
  "apiversion": "1",
  "author": "",
  "color": "#888888",
  "head": "default",
  "tail": "default"
}
```
